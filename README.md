H1! This project is really cool! Based on the users data on their avaliability on certain dates I created a callendar that shows this avaliability. On the first look you can tell the best dates for the party - the more blue certain date is, the more users are avaliable this date (also the more red, the more users are not avaliable). This is made with gradient color based on the overal avaliability score on the certain day. In addition you can view users names on individual dates by clicking on these dates in the calendar.
